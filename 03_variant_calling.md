# Variant calling 

## What is variant calling?

Variant calling is a bioinformatics process used in genomics to identify genetic variations between the genome of an individual and a reference genome. These variations can include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions and deletions (indels), and larger structural variants. 

In this workshop, our variant calling workflow will only detect SNPs. For finding indels or larger structural variants, the workflow will change a bit.
