# Linux operating systems 

## What is Linux? 

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is widely used in various computing devices, from personal computers to servers, mobile devices, embedded systems, and more. It was created by Linux Torvalds in 1991 and is based on the Unix operating system. Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora Linux, and Ubuntu. 

## Linux in biology research 

Linux is extensively used in biology research due to its versatility, robustness, and vast collection of software tools and libraries. 

__Bioinformatics__: Linux offers a wide range of powerful tools and software packages for tasks such as sequence alignment, variant calling, genome assembly, gene expression analysis, next-generation sequencing analysis and more. Popular tools include BLAST, Bowtie, SAMtools, BWA, and Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK). Linux is also popular in the field of molecular modelling, molecular dynamics simulations, and drug discovery. Software packages like GROMACS, AMBER, AutoDock, and VMD are widely used on Linux for tasks such as protein structure prediction, ligand docking, and virtual screening. 

__High-performance computing (HPC) and cluster computing__: Linux is the dominant operating system in the field of high-performance computing. It is commonly used on supercomputers and computing clusters for running computationally intensive bioinformatics analyses, simulations, and large-scale data processing tasks. 

__Server and web hosting__: Linux-based servers are widely used for hosting biological databases, online bioinformatics tools, and web-based resources for researchers and the scientific community.
